# Declarative Configuration For Standalone Nix

## Usage

### Install Nix

In order to use this, you will first need to install Nix.
You can either use your distro's package manager, or use one of the available options
to install Nix.

- [Official Nix Installer][official-installer] - The canonical source for installing nix.
- [Determinate Nix Installer][detsys-installer] - A wrapper around the official installer that has SELinux support, and enables flake features by default.

> Note: Be advised that the Determinate Systems installer has the option for the official
> Nix as well as Determinate's own variant of Nix (Determinate Nix). It will prompt you
> for which one you want to install. System Manager is not tested against Determinate Nix.
> It's recommended to use the official Nix if installing via the Determinate Nix Installer.

### Enable Flake

After installing Nix, you will need to enable flake support, preferable to use nix-shell for the task.

```bash
nix-shell
```

Then run the installed script.

```bash
enable-flake
```

### Run the command

```bash
nix run home-manager/master -- switch --flake .#minimal --impure
```
